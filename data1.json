        "context": " Individuals with Asperger's disorder differ from children with autism in several ways. Unlike children with autism, those with Asperger's typically do not experience language delays or marked unusual behaviors during early childhood. Consequently, parents may not have concerns about their child's early development. Diagnosis of Asperger's may occur later, typically after the age of 3, as children achieve developmental milestones at a typical rate but exhibit distinct social differences. These differences may manifest as social awkwardness, a lack of awareness of conventional social rules, or limited empathy. Impaired social interaction may involve diminished eye contact, disengagement in conversations, and difficulty in interpreting social cues and gestures. Speech patterns may be unusual, with a lack of inflection or overly formal or loud/high-pitched speech. Children with Asperger's may struggle to grasp the subtleties of language, such as irony and humor, and may not fully understand the reciprocal nature of conversations, often appearing to talk 'at' rather than 'to' others. Cognitive ability distinguishes Aspergers from autism, as individuals with Asperger typically do not have a 'clinically significant' cognitive delay and tend to possess average intelligence. Overall, individuals with Aspergers often have a better prognosis than those with autism, partly due to their better cognitive and verbal abilities.",
        "answer": "Asperger's disorder differs from autism in the absence of early language delays and unusual behaviors.
